      "description": "Rural communities across the country are shrinking, but what happens when a place nearly empties out? Over the past year, we’ve focused our reporting in Alexander County, Illinois, at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers—a place The Wall Street Journal declared the fastest-shrinking in America after the 2020 Census. But it’s not alone. Much of rural America is at a crossroads, caught between economic struggles and political uncertainty, trying to figure out how to survive while pushing back against national narratives that often miss the full picture.\n\nThis session will challenge the idea that rural places are just sad, dying communities. We’ll talk about how to highlight voices of strength and resilience while also tackling the policies shaping these places in unique ways. Some issues, like food deserts and child care, hit both urban and rural areas, but the challenges are steeper when funding is limited and people and resources are more spread out.\n\nWe’ll also dig into underreported issues—farming, forestry, and the role of education from preschool to universities—that serve as lifelines for rural communities. And we’ll look at what’s at stake with policy shifts under a second Trump administration. Just as important, we’ll talk about how to cover all of this with the balance and nuance rural people deserve. That includes working with student reporters and regional universities to help fill news deserts, and how big media companies can partner with local reporters to move beyond clichés and get a real understanding of rural life on the inside.",

And beyond the regulatory landscape — in many agencies rapidly degrading under the new administration – learn how sources and other records can help expose misconduct. Also get info on the states' version of Project 2025, being pushed by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). Similar to the national Project 2025, the states-level version seeks to, among other things, empower fossil fuel companies, undermine public education, repress voting rights, and more. Journalists are great at exposing the misbehavior of elected officials – walk away with tips on applying that same sharp scrutiny to company leaders. This session is sponsored by Bloomberg.

You don't need to know Python to write this code.\n\nSome data experience is helpful for this session, but not required.

Meanwhile Americans die in the dark. It's time to break the cycle.\n\nGun violence coverage on our best days can often be reactive—dominated by mass shootings, political cycles, or other fleeting news moments. But as policies shift, sources disappear, and federal oversight weakens, journalists, particularly the editorial class, need to rethink how they cover guns and the communities affected by them.\n\nThis panel will explore how to find on-the-ground sources when traditional ones disappear, how federal rollbacks affect domestic violence, community safety, and policing, and how to avoid amplifying misinformation in fast-moving coverage. With media sometimes struggling to get gun reporting right in so-called “peace times,” the stakes are even higher in times of increased political instability.",

This panel explores how newsrooms can stay committed to equitable hiring and retention while also elevating stories about the erosion of civil rights, attacks on marginalized communities, and systemic barriers to truth-telling. How do we sustain equitable practices in our own newsrooms amid legal, political, and institutional resistance? How do we rebuild trust with communities whose lives and truths are too often overlooked or extracted? This session explores how a deep commitment to belonging—internally and externally—can make investigative journalism more ethical, impactful, and trusted. Panelists will examine how relational journalism practices and inclusive newsroom cultures together fuel more nuanced investigations and broader democratic participation.

This course is designed to give you some tools and tactics to lead individuals and entire teams of investigators more effectively. Learn from five investigative managers from different media at different stages of their leadership careers. How did they launch into their roles, and what experience have they gained along the way?\n\nThis course is for current investigative managers and anyone aspiring to step into such a position in the future. Topics will include: managing compassionately, hiring challenges, transitioning to management, forging partnerships, building relationships, handling resource cuts, organization/structure, tough decisions/conversations, in-house training/growth, delivering feedback, creating inclusive opportunities, and juggling responsibilities/projects/work.\n\nPreregistration is required and seating is limited.",

For starters, sexual misconduct is everywhere (including the journalism industry) and requires diligent and trauma-informed reporting. This panel will cover hard-learned lessons from eight years of reporting and editing sexual misconduct investigations — and from unexpectedly finding ourselves as sources on the other side. We’ll cover the ways we still get this reporting wrong, from pushing traumatized sources too hard to go on-record, to discounting nontraditional records like journal entries or social media messages, to the he-said-she-said of it all. And, we’ll finally put to rest the notion that lived experience is a disqualifier for journalists covering this topic.",
